## Problem
Given an array of strings 
nums
 containing 
n
 
unique
 binary strings each of length 
n
, return 
a binary string of length 

n

 that 
does not appear
 in 

nums

. If there are multiple answers, you may return 
any
 of them
.

 

Example 1:

Input:
 nums = [&quot;01&quot;,&quot;10&quot;]

Output:

Constraints:

	

n == nums.length

	

1 <= n <= 16

	

nums[i].length == n

	

nums[i] 
is either 
&#39;0&#39;
 or 
&#39;1&#39;
.

	
All the strings of 
nums
 are
