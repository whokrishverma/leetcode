**Runtime:** 27 ms
**Memory:** 47084000
## Problem
You are given a binary string 
s
. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:

	

Type-1: Remove
 the character at the start of the string 
s
 and 
append
 it to the end of the string.

	

Type-2: Pick
 any character in 
s
 and 
flip
 its value, i.e., if its value is 
&#39;0&#39;
 it becomes 
&#39;1&#39;
 and vice-versa.

Return 
the 
minimum
 number of 
type-2
 operations you need to perform
 
such that 

s
 
becomes 
alternating
.

The string is called 
alternating
 if no two adjacent characters are equal.

	
For example, the strings 
&quot;010&quot;
 and 
&quot;1010&quot;
 are alternating, while the string 
&quot;0100&quot;
 is not.

 

Example 1:

Input:
 s = &quot;111000&quot;

Output:
 2

Explanation
: Use the first operation two times to make s = &quot;100011&quot;.
Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s = &quot;10
1
01
0
&quot;.

Example 2:

Input:
 s = &quot;010&quot;

Output:
 0

Explanation
: The string is already alternating.

Example 3:

Input:
 s = &quot;1110&quot;

Output:
 1

Explanation
: Use the second operation on the second element to make s = &quot;1
0
10&quot;.

 

Constraints:

	

1 <= s.length <= 10
5

	

s[i]
 is either 
&#39;0&#39;
 or 
&#39;1&#39;
.
