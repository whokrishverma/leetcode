## Problem
You are given a string 
word
 containing 
distinct
 lowercase English letters.

Telephone keypads have keys mapped with 
distinct
 collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 
2
 is mapped with 
[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;]
, we need to push the key one time to type 
&quot;a&quot;
, two times to type 
&quot;b&quot;
, and three times to type 
&quot;c&quot;
 
.

It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 
2
 to 
9
 to 
distinct
 collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to 
any
 amount of letters, but each letter 
must
 be mapped to 
exactly
 one key. You need to find the 
minimum
 number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string 
word
.

Return 
the 
minimum
 number of pushes needed to type 

word
 
after remapping the keys
.

An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that 
1
, 
*
, 
#
, and 
0
 do 
not
 map to any letters.

 

Example 1:

Input:
 word = &quot;abcde&quot;

Output:
 5

Explanation:
 The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
&quot;a&quot; -> one push on key 2
&quot;b&quot; -> one push on key 3
&quot;c&quot; -> one push on key 4
&quot;d&quot; -> one push on key 5
&quot;e&quot; -> one push on key 6
Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

Example 2:

Input:
 word = &quot;xycdefghij&quot;

Output:
 12

Explanation:
 The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
&quot;x&quot; -> one push on key 2
&quot;y&quot; -> two pushes on key 2
&quot;c&quot; -> one push on key 3
&quot;d&quot; -> two pushes on key 3
&quot;e&quot; -> one push on key 4
&quot;f&quot; -> one push on key 5
&quot;g&quot; -> one push on key 6
&quot;h&quot; -> one push on key 7
&quot;i&quot; -> one push on key 8
&quot;j&quot; -> one push on key 9
Total cost is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

 

Constraints:

	

1 <= word.length <= 26

	

word
 consists of lowercase English letters.

	
All letters in 
word
 are distinct.
