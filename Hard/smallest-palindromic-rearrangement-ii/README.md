## Problem
You are given a 

palindromic

 string 
s
 and an integer 
k
.

Return the 
k-th
 

lexicographically smallest

 palindromic 
permutation
 of 
s
. If there are fewer than 
k
 distinct palindromic permutations, return an empty string.

Note:
 Different rearrangements that yield the same palindromic string are considered identical and are counted once.

 

Example 1:

Input:
 
s = &quot;abba&quot;, k = 2

Output:
 
&quot;baab&quot;

Explanation:

	
The two distinct palindromic rearrangements of 
&quot;abba&quot;
 are 
&quot;abba&quot;
 and 
&quot;baab&quot;
.

	
Lexicographically, 
&quot;abba&quot;
 comes before 
&quot;baab&quot;
. Since 
k = 2
, the output is 
&quot;baab&quot;
.

Example 2:

Input:
 
s = &quot;aa&quot;, k = 2

Output:
 
&quot;&quot;

Explanation:

	
There is only one palindromic rearrangement: 
&quot;aa&quot;
.

	
The output is an empty string since 
k = 2
 exceeds the number of possible rearrangements.

Example 3:

Input:
 
s = &quot;bacab&quot;, k = 1

Output:
 
&quot;abcba&quot;

Explanation:

	
The two distinct palindromic rearrangements of 
&quot;bacab&quot;
 are 
&quot;abcba&quot;
 and 
&quot;bacab&quot;
.

	
Lexicographically, 
&quot;abcba&quot;
 comes before 
&quot;bacab&quot;
. Since 
k = 1
, the output is 
&quot;abcba&quot;
.

 

Constraints:

	

1 <= s.length <= 10
4

	

s
 consists of lowercase English letters.

	

s
 is guaranteed to be palindromic.

	

1 <= k <= 10
